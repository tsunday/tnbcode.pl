Hi! ðŸ‘‹

My name is Tomasz and I'm a programmer with 7+ years of experience. I was battle tested both in frontend and backend web development. Here are some short bulletpoints about me:

- currently shifted strongly into backend side
- using Python, Docker, MS SQL Server, Azure and Kubernetes to build backend API, ETL and worker services on a daily basis
- interested in DDD and EDA concepts
- science lover and geek in nature ðŸ¤“
